### Hi, Iâ€™m @indigosees and I make things! ðŸ‘‹ 
I dabble in programming, mainly Python and C++, but I'm learning to pick up C#. 
I plan to eventually branch out to machine learning and AI, but that'll... take a while, ha ha.In the mean time, I'll be getting my hands dirty with personal projects.

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreafpimentel). For art and writing, you may check out my [site](https://indigosees.carrd.co).
